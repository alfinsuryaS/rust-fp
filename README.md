# Functional Programming(FP) in Rust
Functional programming (FP) provides many advantages, and its popularity has been increasing as a result. However, each programming paradigm comes with its own unique jargon and FP is no exception. By providing a glossary, we hope to make learning FP easier.

## Goals
FP style helps you write less code in a more concise and expressive way, with fewer errors. And just sharing my knowledge to learn ✌️
