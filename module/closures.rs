/** 
 * Closures
 * A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state 
 * (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope 
 * from an inner function.

 Code: 
 fmt("Hello World", |j| j.to_string())
 expected output: "Hello World"
